The Task

An automated traffic counter sits by a road and counts the number of cars that go past. Every
half-hour the counter outputs the number of cars seen and resets the counter to zero. You are
part of a development team that has been asked to implement a system to manage this data -
the first task required is as follows :
Write a program that reads a file, where each line contains a timestamp (in
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss format, i.e. ISO 8601) for the beginning of a half-hour and the number of
cars seen that half hour. An example file is included on page 2. You can assume clean input,
as these files are machine-generated.

The program should output:
● The number of cars seen in total
● A sequence of lines where each line contains a date (in yyyy-mm-dd format) and the
number of cars seen on that day (eg. 2016-11-23 289) for all days listed in the input file.
● The top 3 half hours with most cars, in the same format as the input file
● The 1.5 hour period with least​ cars (i.e. 3 contiguous half hour records)

Constraints
● The program must be written in Java. You are welcome (and encouraged) to use any of
the language features of Java 8.
● The program must be accompanied with reasonable levels of unit tests.
● The solution should be developed to professional standards, the code may be used and
extended by your teammates.
● The solution should be deliverable within a couple of hours - please do not spend
excessive amounts of time on this.
